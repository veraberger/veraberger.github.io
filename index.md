Hi! I'm Vera.

## Bio
I am a Churchill Scholar and MPhil candidate in Scientific Computing at the University of Cambridge. My research interests lie in the dynamic lives of stars and their interactions with the surrounding environmentâ€”currently, I study stellar flares using simulation and observations across the electromagnetic spectrum as part of a greater attempt to characterise the impact of stellar flares on the search for habitable exoplanets. My master's thesis focuses on magneto-hydrodynamics simulations of magnetic reconnection, the fundamental but mysterious change in stellar magnetic field topology which produces stellar flares. 

This fall, I'll begin a PhD in Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to study high-energy astrophysics supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and MIT Dean of Science Fellowship.

I graduated from Pomona College in 2023 with majors in mathematics and physics. While at Pomona, I pursued projects on stellar flares, supernova host galaxies, and partially ordered sets. I worked as a teaching assistant and Student Body President.

Outside of science, I play roller derby and cook a dish from a different country each week.
