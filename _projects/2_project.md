Stellar flares are energetic bursts of radiation caused by rapid realignments of magnetic fields on the surface of a star. These events release energy across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to X-rays, with significant implications for planetary atmospheres and surface conditions.

### Flares in the UV

Ultraviolet (UV) emission from stellar flares plays a crucial role in determining the **habitability** of exoplanetary systems. Flare UV emission may drive prebiotic chemistry, erode planetary atmospheres, or produce false biosignatures.

What began as an NSF-REU project at the University of Hawaii to search for stellar flares became the most **comprehensive statistical analysis of UV flares** with simultaneous observations in near- and far-ultraviolet. We showed for the first time that uniformly selected **stellar flares are far-ultraviolet luminous**, and widely-used assumptions for flare emission significantly underestimate the levels of FUV emission we observe ([Berger et al. 2024, MNRAS](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/532/4/4436/7725642)).

Our work was featured by [Space.com](https://www.space.com/red-dwarf-stars-uv-radation-harmful-to-life), the [American Geophysical Union](https://eos.org/articles/small-stars-produce-mighty-uv-flares), [University of Hawaii](https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2024/08/05/risks-to-planets-that-could-host-life/) and the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/astronomers-uncover-risks-to-planets-that-could-host-life).

I've also been experimenting with data sonification; here's a sonified light curve where brightness of the flare is mapped to pitch. This flare displays complex behaviour with multiple peaks in brightness.
