I am an MPhil Scientific Computing candidate at the University of Cambridge with a focus on continuum mechanics and numerical simulations. I graduated from Pomona College in May 2023 with majors in mathematics and physics. My current astrophysics research focuses on stellar flares, and my mathematics research on partially ordered sets. At Pomona, I worked as a teaching assistant and Student Body President.
