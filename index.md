## Bio
I am a first-year PhD student in Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where I study high-energy astrophysics supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and MIT Dean of Science Fellowship.

My research interests lie in the dynamic lives of stars and their interactions with the surrounding environmentâ€”currently, I study stellar flares using simulation and observations across the electromagnetic spectrum to characterise the impact of flares on planetary habitability.
Recently I studied for an MPhil in Scientific Computing at the University of Cambridge as a Churchill Scholar.
My master's thesis focused on magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetic reconnection, a fundamental but mysterious change in stellar magnetic field topology which produces stellar flares.

I graduated from Pomona College in 2023 with majors in mathematics and physics. While at Pomona, I pursued projects on stellar flares, supernova host galaxies, and partially ordered sets. I worked as a teaching assistant and Student Body President.

Outside of science, I play roller derby and cook a dish from a different country each week.
