# About Me
I am a recent graduate of Pomona College, where I majored in mathematics and physics. I am spending the summer at NASA Goddard before starting an MPhil in Scientific Computing at the University of Cambridge on a Churchill Scholarship.

My current astrophysics research focuses on stellar flares, and my mathematics research on partially ordered sets. At Pomona, I worked as a teaching assistant and Student Body President.
