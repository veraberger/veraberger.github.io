I am a first-year PhD student in Physics at MIT, where I conduct spectral timing analysis of some of the fastest and highest-energy astrophysical outbursts in the universe.

Prior to joining MIT, I studied stellar flares, using simulations and multiwavelength observations to investigate the impact of flares on planetary habitability.
I developed magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the magnetic processes that cause stellar flares as a Churchill Scholar at the University of Cambridge.

I previously graduated from Pomona College, where I studied supernova host galaxies and the combinatorics of partially ordered sets.

<!--- Outside of science, I play roller derby and cook a dish from a different country each week. --->
