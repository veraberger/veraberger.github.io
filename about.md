# About Me
I am pursuing an MPhil in scientific computing as a Churchill Scholar at the University of Cambridge, with a focus on fluid dynamics and numerical simulations. I recently graduated from Pomona College, where I majored in mathematics and physics and worked as a teaching assistant and Student Body President. My current astronomy research focuses on stellar flares in the ultraviolet and their potential impact on the habitability of orbiting planets.
