A laundry list of advice for applying to the Churchill, NSF GRFP, and Marshall scholarships.

My qualifications: I am a 2023-24 Churchill Scholar, Marshall Scholarship finalist, and 2x NSF GRFP recipient. 
<!--- I went through two rounds of astronomy and physics graduate applications, and was accepted to 7/10 PhD programs my second time applying, including Harvard astronomy and MIT physics.  --->

# General advice

- The most helpful advice I received: show reviewers why it would be a *tragedy* for you not to pursue your program of choice. Take lots of time to figure out what you can say about your experience and goals that nobody else can.

- Apply for any and all funding that  1) you are eligible for, and 2) will allow you to pursue your program of choice,
whether that be Gates Cambridge, Churchill, Marshall, Rhodes, Mitchell, or internal university scholarships. 
Cambridge even has college- and department-specific funding which is worth looking into ([here’s](https://www.student-funding.cam.ac.uk/) a good starting point), and individual professors may have funding for you as well.
<!--- It goes without saying that these fellowships are highly competitive and 
Receiving a rejection from any one program says little about your competitiveness as an applicant.--->

- Regardless of the outcome, the fellowship application process should provide a valuable opportunity to reflect on your experiences as an undergraduate and articulate a vision for your career.

# Churchill Scholarship

**I’m on the fence. How do I know if I should apply?**  
- If you are interested, eligible, and have time to complete the application, do consider applying. 
There is an opportunity cost—these applications are time-intensive and you may want more time to work, research, apply to jobs, enjoy your final year of undergrad etc.  
However, this is a question often asked by people who are underrepresented in science. 
I almost did not apply because I thought I had no chance, and changed my mind after one person encouraged me. 
If you need that encouragement, here it is.

**Do I need to reach out to potential supervisors before applying?**  
- Yes, if you’re applying for a research-based MPhil (check the Churchill scholarship website for requirements)
- It’s probably a good idea to reach out to potential supervisors regardless.
If supervisors express any openness to working with you, include that in your Program of Study statement.

**Should I have a Goldwater scholarship?**  
- I didn’t! However, ⅔ of my cohort were Goldwater recipients. I think it’s helpful to consider the Goldwater not as a prerequisite for Churchill, but indicative of the type of people that might make competitive Churchill applicants: commitment to scientific research and “intellectual intensity.”

**How does the Academic and Research history statement compare to standard PhD statements of purpose?**  
- Much of this should be similar to a PhD research statement, but a major difference is that it needs to be understandable and motivating to scientists outside your field. I dedicated the end portion of my statement to explaining my subfield of astronomy and some of its unique challenges to contextualize my stated goals for the fellowship and future career.

**Churchill Scholarship says they’re looking for people with “jagged edges” rather than “well-rounded applicants.” What if I’ve done other activities?**  
- The most important thing is that you’ve taken advantage of the opportunities you’ve had, and those activities make you a better scientist.
- The website also says that the “Committee takes into account interests and achievements outside of research.” I mostly let those other activities speak for themselves in my CV (and likely in my recommendation letters), but included a couple of sentences on how they informed my goals to become a professor.



# National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (NSF GRFP)

## General

This section is slim because there is a wealth of existing resources on GRFP applications (e.g. [Alex Lang's page](https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship))

Check your eligibility for other federally funded fellowships:  
- National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program (NDSEG)  
- Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration Stewardship Science Graduate Fellowship (DOE NNSA SSGF)  
- Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship Program (DOE CSGF)

## Broader Impacts

- Be specific! All three of my NSF reviewers in 2023 commented that they would have liked more specificity about my planned outreach efforts.  
- This section needs to touch on your *future* plans, not just what you’ve accomplished as an undergrad. 
  This should allow you to think bigger about the sort of impact you want your research or outreach efforts to have on the 5-6 year timescale of a PhD and beyond.  
- *The NSF doesn’t expect your work to transform society.*
They actually have a very specific (but wide-ranging) definition of broader impacts (see e.g. the first bullet point on [this page](https://new.nsf.gov/science-matters/nsf-101-five-tips-your-broader-impacts-statement), 
and some examples [here](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/learn/broader-impacts)).
- *tl;dr?* The definition implies that broader impacts can be attained by your *research* or by *other outreach activities*. 
If you’re struggling to figure out how your research could speak to any of these criteria, consider focusing more on any outreach / STEM inclusivity work you may have done or plan to do in grad school. 
- If you’re applying for astronomy programs, check out the [Astro2020 decadal survey](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/resources/decadal-survey/2020-decadal-survey/) 
and consider writing about how your work fits under the broader goals for the field of astronomy.

# Marshall Scholarship Interviews

How I prepared:  
- Mock interviews, first with my undergrad professors and a previous scholar, and later with friends. They spent 20 minutes giving me constructive feedback afterward which I found helpful, so if you schedule a mock interview I would recommend structuring in some time for feedback. And schedule it early—it’s hard to find a time when multiple professors are available. I also gave my application to some friends and they grilled me on my essays.  
- Wrote down references for publications related to the research I discussed in my application. I did end up using these in my interview.  
- Prepared anecdotes relevant to my experience in research & leadership.  
- Researched differences between science in the US & UK, and kept up with science & general news in the UK.  
- Found out who might be present for my interview. Marshall publicizes their regional committee membership. It turned out that the only scientist on my regional committee was an expert in the exact niche topic I spent my undergrad researching. ⅔ of my interview were highly technical questions on this research topic, which I was not expecting given the typical Marshall interview advice. This leads me to suggest that interviews may be highly dependent on the makeup of your committee.
