# About Me

I am pursuing an MPhil in Scientific Computing as a Churchill Scholar at the University of Cambridge, with a focus on continuum mechanics and numerical simulations. I graduated from Pomona College in May 2023 with majors in mathematics and physics. My current astrophysics research focuses on stellar flares, and my mathematics research on partially ordered sets. At Pomona, I worked as a teaching assistant and Student Body President.

My current astronomy research focuses on stellar flares in the ultraviolet and their potential impact on the habitability of orbiting planets.
