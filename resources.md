## Graduate fellowship application advice
My qualifications: I am a 2023-24 Churchill Scholar, Marshall Scholarship finalist, and 2x NSF GRFP recipient. I went through two rounds of astronomy and physics graduate applications, and was accepted to 7/10 PhD programs my second time applying, including Harvard and MIT. 
While I can’t conclusively say what helped my applications the most, I’ve learned a lot from this process. 

## General fellowship advice

<u>Apply for any funding that you are eligible<u> for that would allow you to complete the program you want to do, whether that be Gates Cambridge, Churchill, Marshall, Rhodes, Mitchell, or internal university scholarships. Cambridge even has college- and department-specific funding which is worth looking into ([here’s](https://www.student-funding.cam.ac.uk/) a good starting point), and individual professors might have funding for you as well. 

<u>The most helpful advice I received:<u> show reviewers why it would be a *tragedy* for you not to pursue your program of choice.

At the very least, the fellowship application process should provide a valuable opportunity to reflect on your experiences as an undergraduate and articulate a vision for your career.

## Churchill Scholarship FAQs

1. Do I need to reach out to potential supervisors before applying? 

Yes, if you’re applying for a research-based MPhil (check the Churchill scholarship website for requirements), but it’s probably smart to reach out to potential supervisors regardless of whether it’s required. If supervisors express any openness to working with you, include that in your Program of Study statement.

2. Should I have a Goldwater scholarship?

I didn’t\! However, ⅔ of my cohort were Goldwater recipients. I think it’s helpful to consider the Goldwater not as a prerequisite for Churchill, but indicative of the type of people that might make competitive Churchill applicants: commitment to scientific research and “intellectual intensity.”

4. Churchill Scholarship says they’re looking for people with “jagged edges” rather than “well-rounded applicants.” What if I’ve done other activities?

The most important thing is that you’ve taken advantage of the opportunities you’ve had, and those activities make you a better scientist. The website also says that the “Committee takes into account interests and achievements outside of research.” I mostly let those other activities speak for themselves in my CV (and likely in my recommendation letters), but included a couple of sentences on how they informed my goals to become a professor. 

5. I’m on the fence. How do I know if I should apply? 

If you are interested, eligible, and have time to complete the application, do consider applying. There is an opportunity cost—these applications are time-intensive and you may want more time to work, research, apply to jobs, enjoy your final year of undergrad etc.

However, this is a question often asked by people who are underrepresented in science. I almost did not apply because I thought I had no chance, and changed my mind after one person encouraged me. If you need that encouragement, here it is.
