I am a second-year PhD student in Physics at MIT, where I study how black holes change on timescales from microseconds to years.

Prior to joining MIT, I completed an MPhil in Scientific Computing at the University of Cambridge, developing magnetohydrodynamic simulations of stellar plasmas.
I received my undergraduate degree from Pomona College, where I studied supernova host galaxies and the combinatorics of partially ordered sets.
