I am studying scientific computing at the University of Cambridge with a focus on fluid dynamics and numerical simulations. I am a recent graduate of Pomona College, where I majored in mathematics and physics. My current astrophysics research focuses on stellar flares, and my mathematics research on partially ordered sets. At Pomona, I worked as a teaching assistant and Student Body President.
